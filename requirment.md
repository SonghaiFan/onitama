Onitama is a two-player abstract strategy game (think chess-lite) that plays out on a 5×5 board. Here’s how it works:

---

## 🎯 Objective

You win by achieving one of two “Ways”:

- **Way of the Stone**: Capture your opponent’s Master pawn.
- **Way of the Stream**: Move your Master pawn onto your opponent’s Temple Arch (their starting center square) .

---

## 🎲 Game Components

- **Board**: 5×5 grid with a Temple Arch at each player’s back row center.
- **Pawns**: Each player has 1 Master and 4 Students.
- **Move Cards**: 16 cards total, but only 5 are used per game: each player gets 2 in hand, plus 1 shared starter card.

---

## Setup

1. Lay the board and place each Master on their Temple Arch. Students go on either side .
2. Shuffle 16 move cards; deal 2 to each player face up.
3. Reveal a 5th card; its color symbol determines who starts, and it's placed to the start player’s right. The other 10 cards are set aside .

---

## 🔁 Game Turn

Each turn consists of two steps:

**1. Move & Attack**

- Pick one of your two move cards and choose either Master or Student to move according to that card’s pattern (relative to the pawn’s current position).
- You **must** move if possible; if no legal move exists, you pass—but still exchange cards .
- You can jump over pieces, but cannot land on your own piece.
- Landing on an opponent’s pawn captures it .

**2. Exchange Cards**

- Place the used card to the left of the board, flipped 180° for your opponent to use later.
- Pick up the card that was on the right side of the board to refill your hand .

Turn passes to opponent. Cards circulate among the 5 active each game.

## 🔚 End of Game

Play continues until:

- You **capture the opponent’s Master** (Way of the Stone), or
- You **move your Master into their Temple Arch** (Way of the Stream) .

---

## 🧠 Strategy Tips

- Each move card you play becomes accessible to your opponent—think ahead!
- Control the center—it's powerful while cards flow .
- Balance aggression and defense; anticipate your opponent’s next move-set .

### ✅ Summary

- **Setup**: Place Masters & Students, deal 5 cards.
- **Turn**: Move using a card, then rotate it.
- **Win**: Capture Master or reach opponent's Temple Arch.
