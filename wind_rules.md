Here are the rules for the **Way of the Wind** expansion (also called **Wind of the Way**), which adds a neutral **Wind Spirit** piece and special cards to Onitama:

---

## üçÉ Way of the Wind ‚Äî Key Rules

Throughout below, ‚ÄúWind Spirit‚Äù refers to a **neutral piece** neither player controls.

---

### üì¶ Components

- 1 **Wind Spirit** miniature (neutral)
- 8‚Äì10 "Wind Spirit" cards (each with two separate move sections)
- Optionally 2 new regular move cards (`Goat` and `Sheep`) or added to other expansions ([magicmadhouse.co.uk][1], [ESCAPETHEROOMers][2], [purplephoenixgames.com][3])

---

### üéØ Setup

1. Include Wind Spirit only **if both players agree**, typically in Wind-of-the-Way mode.
2. Shuffle base game cards with the new Wind Spirit cards.
3. Place the **Wind Spirit mini** in the **center square** of the 5√ó5 board before play begins ([purplephoenixgames.com][3]).

---

### üîÅ Turn Sequence

When using a **Wind Spirit card**, follow this order:

1. **Play Wind Spirit card**:

   - Move your **Student or Master** using the top grid section.
   - Then move the **Wind Spirit** using the bottom grid section.

2. **Special swap rule**:

   - If the Wind Spirit moves onto a **Student‚Äôs square**, they **swap places** (Wind Spirit does **not** capture) ([purplephoenixgames.com][3], [GitHub][4]).
   - It **cannot** move onto a **Master's square**, nor can it be captured by any pawn ([purplephoenixgames.com][3], [Zatu Games][5]).

3. **Pass the played card**:

   - Just as in base Onitama, you place it into the shared slot to be picked up later.

---

### üö´ Wind Spirit Interactions

- The Wind Spirit is **impassable** for Master and Student pawns: you cannot end your move on its square unless using a swap card.
- It **cannot capture** or be captured ([Wikipedia][6], [Arcane Wonders][7], [purplephoenixgames.com][3]).

---

### üß† Strategic Impact

- Adds **blocker/swap dynamic**: swapping creates strategic disruption, especially blocking rushes toward Temple Arch ([Wikipedia][6]).
- Increases complexity by allowing up to **two moves per turn** (one pawn + one Wind Spirit move) ([Zatu Games][5]).

---

### üé≤ Gameplay Options

- Typically, players use **2 Wind Spirit cards** per match (adjustable by preference) ([GitHub][4], [Zatu Games][5]).
- Cards can be **blended with base cards** or played in standalone Wind-of-the-Way variant ([Zatu Games][5], [GitHub][4]).
